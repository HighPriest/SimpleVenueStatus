## Interaction
The main image is zoomable with scrollwheel & scrollable with CTRL + LeftClick hold.  
You can click server rooms (yellow squares) & cameras (red & green cones) to preview in side window.  
You can view all server rooms in "Widok szaf" selectable from bottom menu.

## Running
To preview how this application looks, open index.html / szafy.html in a browser.  
To get full experience, you are going to need to serve the files using a http server, so the browser doesn't complain about CORS fetch'ing of .json files.
